## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Carlos Bravo and I like to make bots to some games I play and make computers do my job, in my free time I study Computer Science at UFRJ. 

I took an Informatics technical course at CEFET/RJ and worked as a web developer at Exablack. Currently I'm working in a scientific initiation in Deep Learning.
